description: Ghasts can still cause damage but do not destroy blocks or start fires. This is a super simple and lightweight plugin designed to be an alternative to the Vanilla Tweaks datapack. Datapacks can hurt server performance and this plugin aims to eliminate one. This plugin has no config and is just plug and play.
